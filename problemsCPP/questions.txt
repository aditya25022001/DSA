given array of n integers 
perform two operations select i, j (i!=j)
A[i]&A[j]=X
A[i]=A[i]^X
A[j]=A[j]^X
check if the array can be converted to 0
approach --> check each of 32 bits in every number if no of ones in a bit position is even then true else false

different bits sum pairwise

single number ii

longest substring without repeating characters //hashmap two pointer

square root without sqrt

factorial trailing zeroes (approach count no of 5s in the number 25 -> 2 5s)
void f(){
    int c=0;
    int p=5;
    while(n/p>=1){
        c+=n/p;
        p*=5;
    }
    return c;
}

Median of 2d matrix

Palindrome partitioning

Maximum sum of subsequence without adjacent
